# Flappy Birb – Pose and Hand Gesture Controlled Game

Flappy Birb is a computer vision–based interactive game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird. This project replaces traditional keyboard-only controls with real-time arm and hand gesture recognition using a webcam. The system allows users to control gameplay using natural body movements, providing a touch-free and immersive gaming experience.
